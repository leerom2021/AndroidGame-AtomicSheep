# AndroidGame-AtomicSheep
My first game on the play store!

Hi, my name is Romain Bertrand(Leerom), I am french and I am am 34 years old.
I have been developping a game using java code called Atomic Sheep and I wanted to give try to Github to check how it can help me.
I started from 0 in coding and I have been teaching my self with videos on internet.

Otherwise I am fond of sport and especialy soccer. I like to travel a lot too.

Hope we can work together!

Romain
